## ✅ Summary

    GradioDisplay manages shared state and thread-safe updates.

    DisplayService receives gRPC requests, decodes images, and sends them to the Gradio display.

    The system runs the gRPC and Gradio servers concurrently using threads.

    All logic is contained in functions or classes — minimal global scope.
