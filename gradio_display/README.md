## ✅ Summary

    GradioDisplay manages shared state and thread-safe updates.

    DisplayService receives gRPC requests, decodes images, and sends them to the Gradio display.
    
    JSON Control messages:
    
    -  **aispgradio** :in every data generated by this componnent
        -  empty : the contents is empty
        -  error : error
        -  

    The system runs the gRPC and Gradio servers concurrently using threads.

    All logic is contained in functions or classes — minimal global scope.
