"""boxes-webui — a declarative web layer over a fleet of "boxes".

The core (``webui.core``) is deliberately *box-agnostic*: it knows the
envelope's shape and nothing about any specific box.  All box knowledge
lives in the YAML definitions under ``webui/boxes/`` — the same "smart
about shape, dumb about content" principle as ``boxes_client``.
